About branches
==============

There are two main branches:

* Release

  Used for tagged releases only. This is the "stable" branch.

* development

  Bleeding edge version, where we don't expect everything to work.

Other branches will be named *wip-XX* (for developping new features) and *issueNN-XX* (for fixing bugs).

In order to supply code, fork the development branch and send a pull request.
